# About
Some images used for the clustering can be of low quality or even blurred.
To improve its quality , some type of contrasting has to be done on it to get the better output.
And So , we chose to use PCS i.e. **Partial Contrast Stretching** technique for this purpose.

# PCS technique
 Partial Spatial Starching (PCS) is used to improve the image quality and
contrast of the image. It is done by stretching and compression process. By applying this technique, the pixel range of
lower threshold value and upper threshold value will be mapped to a new pixel range and stretched linearly to a wide
range of pixels within new lower stretching value, and the remaining pixels will experience compression. \
